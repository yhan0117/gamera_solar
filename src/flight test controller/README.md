firmware/src has the main.cpp file, which is the code you upload to the onboard MCU/ Arduino. In the loop() function, the script constantly monitors the Serial port (to be changed to radio) to read 4 int numbers,  do some conversions with the numbers, then send the value to the motor, via PWM with the command servo.write().\
control/read_keyboard.py is essentially the "controller" that uses the arrow keys as the joystick. It also loops indefinitely (in main function), read the keyboard input, keep track of the motor commands (the 4 int variables), and send to the MCU via Serial. 
The radio directory has two arduino files we used for testing the nRF24L01 modules. There's a transmit file and a receiver file, and those need to be uploaded to two separate MCUs, both connected to their own radio module. More details on how to use those modules can be found in [Dejan's Blog](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-wireless-communication-nrf24l01-tutorial/)
